# What is house party?

[Houseparty](https://houseparty.com/) is described as a 'virtual party platform'. It is an social networking app that allows people to video chat in a 'room'. Using a code to enter the room, users can join chats with friends and participate in in built features such as quizzes and games.

I created a house-party clone with the ability to enter a room using a code with a single feature that allows users to play and skip music. I used python and javascript to create a full stack web application with Django and React and learnt about how to integrate the application with the Spotify API. As my first full stack web application and my first time using React, this was a great challenge but nonetheless the best use of my time to learn during lockdown. 

Credits goes to the youtuber [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) for providing guidance and introduction to using React with a python server.
